# Wordcloud-project

This was one of my initial projects. It involves accessing Facebook (now Meta) Messenger through Selenium Webdriver and sending a WordCloud to a chosen user (or multiple) generated based on downloaded data from Facebook.

Not sure if it works at the moment as the project is 2+ years old and has not been touched since.
