# Wordcloud-project

This was one of my initial Python projects done over the summer before my first year at University. It involves accessing Facebook (now Meta) Messenger through Selenium Webdriver and sending a WordCloud to a chosen user (or multiple) generated based on downloaded data from Facebook.

Not sure if it works at the moment as the project is 2+ years old and has not been touched since.
